# Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis

This repositoy demonstrates some data analysis work we conducted on the Dominick's scanner data.The database covers store-level scanner data collected at Dominick's Finer Foods over a period of more than seven years (1989-1997). Our goal is to build a model that can describe the relationship between price, promotion, and sales of different products.      

The main data analysis work is described in the Modelling_AggSales.md file. A detailed description of the functions we created by ourselves is listed in another document - Func_AggSales.md
