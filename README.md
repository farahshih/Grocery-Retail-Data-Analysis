# Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis

This repositoy demonstrates some data analysis work we conducted on the Dominick's Database provided by James M. Kilts Center, University of Chicago Booth School of Business (https://research.chicagobooth.edu/kilts/marketing-databases/dominicks).    

The Dominick's database covers store-level scanner data collected at Dominick's Finer Foods over a period of more than seven years. Our goal is to build a model that can describe the relationship between the price, promotion, and sales of a sub-category or a product.     

The main data analysis work is described in the Modelling_AggSales.md file. A detailed description of the functions we created by ourselves is listed in another document - Func_AggSales.md
