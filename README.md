# Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis

This repositoy demonstrates some data analysis work we conducted on the Dominick's scanner data.The database covers store-level scanner data collected at Dominick's Finer Foods over a period of more than seven years (1989-1997). Our goal is to build a model that can describe the relationship between price, promotion, and sales of different products.      

The file Summary.md summarizes graphs and models we built to predict sales of frozen juice. A detailed step-by-step data analysis is described in the file Modelling_AggSales.md. All functions we designed on our own are listed in the file  Func_AggSales.md
