# Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis ï¼ˆThe Nielsen Datasets)

The Nielsen Datasets involves two datasets:     
1) Consumer Panel Data (a panel of 60,000 US households and their purchases of fast-moving consumer goods from 90 retail chains)      
2) Retail Scanner Data (weekly product data for 2.6 million UPCs and their sales data from over 35,000 grocery and drug stores in recent 10 years).      
Data Description: https://research.chicagobooth.edu/nielsen

The analysis techniques we applied on the Nielsen Datasets are similar with the Dominick's Finer Foods datasets. However, since the Nielsen datasets is a private dataset, this folder only shows a few Python and R scripts (without any data) for reference.
