# Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis （The Nielsen Datasets)

The Nielsen Datasets involves two datasets:     
1) consumer panel data (a panel of 60,000 US households and their purchases of fast-moving consumer goods from 90 retail chains)      
2) retail scanner data (weekly product data for 2.6 million UPCs and their sales data from over 35,000 grocery and drug stores in recent 10 years).      
Data Description: https://research.chicagobooth.edu/nielsen

Just like we did on the Dominick's Finer Foods datasets, our objective is to build a model that can describe the relationship between price, promotion, and sales of different products.       
It is a private dataset and thus this folder only shows a few Python and R scripts (without any data) for references.
